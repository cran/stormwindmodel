\title{Calculate surface wind speed from gradient}
\usage{
gradient_to_surface(wind_gl_aa, cdist)
}
\arguments{
\item{wind_gl_aa}{A numerical value with estimated gradient-level wind speed
(m / s) at a grid point.}

\item{cdist}{A numerical value with radius from the storm center to the grid
point, in kilometers.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector with the estimated symmetric surface wind speed at
   the grid point, in meters / second.
}
\description{
Calculates the surface wind speed based on an estimated gradient
wind speed at a point and the radius from the storm center to
the grid point.
}
\details{
The reduction factor is based on Figure 3 of Knaff et al., 2003.
Over water, it is estimated to be 0.9 up to a radius of 100 km,
0.75 for a radius of 700 km or more, and decrease linearly between
a radius of 100 km and 700 km. Points over land should use a reduction
factor that is 20\% lower. Because all of the counties are over
land, the function makes this adjustment for all grid points.
}
\note{
This function is only appropriate to use for points that are over
   land.
