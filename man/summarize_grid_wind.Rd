\title{Generate wind summaries for grid point}
\usage{
summarize_grid_wind(grid_wind, tint = 0.25, gust_duration_cut = 20,
  sust_duration_cut = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{grid_wind}{A dataframe with a time series of modeled wind speeds at
a location, as created by \code{\link{calc_grid_wind}}.}

\item{tint}{Interval (in hours) to which to interpolate the tracks. The
default is 0.25 (i.e., 15 minutes)}

\item{gust_duration_cut}{The wind speed, in meters per second, to use as a
cutoff point for determining the duration of gust winds. The function
will calculate the minutes during the storm when surface-level gust winds
were above this speed at the location.}

\item{sust_duration_cut}{The wind speed, in meters per second, to use as a
cutoff point for determining the duration of gust winds. The function
will calculate the minutes during the storm when surface-level gust winds
were above this speed at the location.}
}
\value{
Returns a one-row matrix with wind characteristics for a single
   location. The wind characteristics given are:
   \itemize{
     \item{\code{vmax_gust}: Maximum value of surface-level (10 meters)
       gust winds, in meters per second, over the length of the
       storm at the given location}
     \item{\code{vmax_sust}: Maximum value of surface-level (10 meters)
       sustained winds, in meters per second, over the length of the
       storm at the given location}
     \item{\code{gust_duration}: Length of time, in minutes, that
       surface-level gust winds were above a specified value (default is
       20 meters per second)}
     \item{\code{sust_duration}: Length of time, in minutes, that
       surface-level sustained winds were above a specified value (default is
       20 meters per second}
   }
}
\description{
Summarizes the wind time series for a single grid point, as
created by \code{\link{calc_grid_wind}}.
