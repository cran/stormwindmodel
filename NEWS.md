# stormwindmodel 0.1.2

* Resolve a warning on CRAN when rebuilding vignettes in Windows
* Improve method of interpolating storm tracks between synoptic times.
Now uses natural cubic spline for location (latitude and longitude) and
linear interpolation for maximum wind speed (in line with interpolation
by ibtracs).
