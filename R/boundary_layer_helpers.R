#' Add inflow angle
#'
#' This function adds an inflow angle to the angle of the wind direction.
#' It calculates an inflow angle as a function of the distance from the
#' storm center to a location (Phadke et al. 2003), and then adds 20 degrees to
#' this inflow angle to account for the location being over land rather than
#' over water.
#'
#' @param gwd A numeric vector giving direction of gradient wind at a location,
#'    in degrees. Due east is 0 degrees, due north 90 degrees, etc.
#' @param cdist A numeric vector giving radius (in kilometers) from the storm
#'    center to the location being modeled.
#' @inheritParams will3_right
#'
#' @return Numeric vector with the gradient wind direction (in degrees),
#'    adjusted with an inflow angle appropriate for being over land and for the
#'    location's distance from the storm's center.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' This function uses equations 11a-c from Phadke et al. (2003).
#'
#' @note
#'
#' This function is only appropriate for modeling wind speeds for locations
#' that are over land.
